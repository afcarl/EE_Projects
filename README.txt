Hello!

This Git repo contains personal and class projects by Kate.
Here is a list of the projects and descriptions:

1) Op Amp Design
This was the final project of EE140 Analog IC Design at UC Berkeley.
The PDF explains my design project and analyzes how the final design
performed in SPICE simulation.

2) Buck Regulator
I designed, did the layout, and tested a buck regulator to power servos for the 2013 robotics kit for PiE Robotics.
PiE is a student-run organization dedicated to providing a low cost robotics competition experience to local high schools.

3) Magnetic Levitation
This was on of our lab projects in my EE128 Feedback Controls class where 
we built a lead controller to levitate a metal ball.  The PDF contains the lab
report and there is also a cool video  at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hf-9Wg1Nqxw

4) Siren Circuit
I made a two-transistor oscillator circuit that makes a siren noise (and you can alter how fast the siren goes with a pot!) 
This board was for an introductory electrical engineering lab as part of CS KickStart.
(CS KickStart is a program here at Berkeley for incoming female freshman who are interested in CS and EE.  
Check them out here: http://cs-kickstart.berkeley.edu/
(This is a PDF of the first board I ever made so keep that in mind please! XD).
