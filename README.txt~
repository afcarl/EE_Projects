Hello!

This Git repo contains personal and class projects by Kate.
Here is a list of the projects and descriptions:

1) Op Amp Design
This was the final project of EE140 Analog IC Design at UC Berkeley.
The PDF explains my design project and analyzes how the final design
performed in SPICE simulation.

2) Magnetic Levitation
This is just a cool video from my EE128 Feedback Controls class where 
we built a lead controller to levitate a metal ball.
